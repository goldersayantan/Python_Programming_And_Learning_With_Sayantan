# Syntax of help()
help([object])

"""
object (Optional): The object you want to get help on. It could be a module, class, function, or even an individual object. 
If no object is provided, help() will display general information about Python and its documentation.

How help() Works
If you call help() with no arguments, it launches an interactive help system in the terminal or console.
If you pass an object (such as a function, class, or module) to help(), it will display documentation for that specific object.
